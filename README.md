# UFOs

## Overview

We designed a webpage to analysis data from UFO sightings from all over the country. We used JavaScript for the design and function of the webpage, which helped us include a dynamic table with filtering features to help sort and organize the UFO data. Bootstrap and CSS was used to put together the customization of the webpage. 

## Results

By default, the webpage shows all the imported data with no filters, as shown in the following screenshot. The data can be browsed with no filter applied, but if you want to narrow your search to a specific city you use the ‘Enter a City’ field to enter the city you’re searching for and clicking enter to clicking away from the field. The table will update with results from the city you specified. You can add more filter criteria by entering something into one of the various other fields. The field can also be cleared out and the table will refresh with the data that reflects the remaining filters.

## Summary

Overall, this webpage proves to be a solid source to review the collected data. One drawback is that the user doesn’t know which filter criteria to use on some of the filters. It would be nice to have a drop-down selection in the filters to select a city from the dataset. Future development should look into creating a sort feature on each heading. Ideally, you could click on the header and the column would sort either ascending or descending depending on the user’s preference. Another useful feature would be to put count results on the filters. I would like to be able to see “4 results found” when searching for ‘circle’ in the shape filter.
